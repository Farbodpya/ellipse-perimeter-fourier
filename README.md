# Fast and Accurate Ellipse Perimeter Approximation Using Fourier Series

This project provides a high-precision and efficient method for estimating the perimeter of an ellipse using a low-degree Fourier series. It is more accurate than Ramanujan's formula and significantly faster than elliptic integrals.

## Features
- Fourier-based approximation with sub-millipercent error
- High-speed computation (millisecond range)
- Modular, readable codebase
- Benchmark comparison with Ramanujan and elliptic integral methods

## Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `mpmath`

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
